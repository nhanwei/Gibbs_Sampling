# Gibbs_Sampling

We have a dataset for the level of ozone pollution in Los Angeles in the year 1976. The dataset has been split into training and test datasets, namely Xtraining, Xtest, Ytraining and Ytest. The X datasets contain the 90 predictors such as wind speed, humidity, pressure, etc. The Y datasets contain the response variables. Both X and Y datasets have been centered and normalised. 

Here we are fitting a linear model, y = X*beta + e. In our model, y is the response variable, X is a predictor matrix and beta is the coefficient vector. e is the error term with
